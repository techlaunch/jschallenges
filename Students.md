# Here is a list of students
Probably any school has a list of students like the following, maybe more extense and comprehensive. 
```
var students = [{
	name: "Salvi",
	gpa: 4.0,
	class: "WEB1100"
},{
	name: "Jeronimo",
	gpa: 1.3,
	class: "WEB1010"
},{
	name: "Cachito",
	gpa: 1.4,
	class: "WEB1010"
},{
	name: "Maria",
	gpa: 2.3,
	class: "WEB1100"
}];
```

# Challenge #1
Display the name of all students which GPA is lower than 2 in a unordered list. If I make any update to the list of students or add/remove students to the list, your code has to work.

# Challenge #2
Create a table with the headers "Student", "GPA" and "Class". Display all the students from the list matching the object field to the three columns of the table.

# Challenge #3
Display the name of all students in a unordered list grouped by class name. Your code has to result on something like the example below:

* WEB1100
    * Salvi
    * Maria
* WEB1010
    * Jeronimo
    * Cachito
